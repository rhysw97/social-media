For my social media app I am building a platform to help people find new friends to go to gigs with.

Features:

 User profiles (register, login and logout, pages)
Post system (comments and likes Video and image )
Event finder with option to view by genre
chatrooms / forums based around events
Friend system
Artist profiles to show they have a gig
Venues looking for artists

I have found that more people are going to gigs alone and especially with more alternative music it may be harder to find people to go to gigs with. This is why I want to build an app to help people show what gigs they would be interested in going to and meeting new people based around that. This is why I feel it is important to have chatrooms and forum boards based around each event giving people the best opportunity to meet others.
